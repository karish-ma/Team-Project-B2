    <h4 style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;" class="analysis">The frequency in which Trump tweets about the wall shows that he does a strategic use of the term according to the political context. This trend is most noticeably in the last weeks when he decided to shut down the U.S. government over his demand to have Congress approve funding for the construction of a wall along the US-Mexico border. As shown in the graph, December 2018 was the month in which Trump has tweeted the most about the &ldquo;wall&rdquo; (50 tweets) since he launched his Presidential campaign in June of 2015. The graph also shows other less pronounced peaks that coincide with political events like the Iowa Caucus (the first major contest of the US presidential primary season) and Trump&rsquo;s travel ban announcement. More recently, in January 2018, Trump tweeted 13 times about the wall while he was asking the Congress funds for building the &ldquo;Wall&rdquo; in exchange of maintaining DACA.</h4>
