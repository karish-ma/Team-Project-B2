  <p class="analysis"> In this series of graphs, we analyze President Trump’s rhetoric around the wall from the campaign trail until present day. The graph above shows President Trump’s total number of tweets about the wall in relation to total number of tweets about Latin American migrants, asylees, and immigrants from June 2015-January 2019. 
	<li>The Y-axis scale = Total number of tweets from both categories measured.</a></li>  
	<li>To see the number of tweets in each category move your mouse over each column.</a></li></p>
