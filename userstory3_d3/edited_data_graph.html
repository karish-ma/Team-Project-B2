  <h1 id="pagetitle">President Trump Tweets More About Migration to the Border Than About the Wall</h1>
  <p class="subtitle">Number of Tweets about Latin American  Asylees, Migrants, and Immigrants and Number of Tweets about “The Wall”. </p>

  <div id="wallvspeoplechart" class="chart"></div>


  <p class="belowchart"> In this series of graphs, we analyze President Trump’s rhetoric around the wall from the campaign trail until present day. The graph above shows President Trump’s total number of tweets about the wall in relation to total number of tweets about Latin American migrants, asylees, and immigrants from June 2015-January 2019.

  <ul class="belowchart">
	   <li>The Y-axis scale = Total number of tweets from both categories measured.</li>  
	   <li>To see the number of tweets per month in each category move your mouse over the columns.</li>  
  </ul>

  <p class="analysis">TAKEAWAYS: 
  To contextualize how "the wall” works as part of a broader Trumpian conversation, we analyzed a list of terms Trump frequently uses when referring to those crossing the border. In these tweets Trump discusses migrations issues, concerns about the US-Mexico border, impressions on the caravan, etc. The graph visualizes “migration terms” and lets us see a more consistent trend in the discussion of migration-related issues by Donald Trump.

  President Trump’s references to migration terms far exceeds his references to the border wall itself.
