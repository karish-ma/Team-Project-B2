    <p class="analysis">
    The volume of tweets that include specific terms is obtained from a manual search of @realDonaldTrump’s twitter feed from June 2009 to January 2018 facilitated by  trumptwitterarchive.com/archive.  Data related to number of RTs, Favs, and dates are also retrieved from the same source.

    <p class="analysis">
    The period of the search starts in June 2015, as it was the month in which Trump announced his candidacy for President of the United States. 
    <p class="analysis">
    The frequency of tweets was grouped monthly to appreciate significant variations over time.
    <p class="analysis">
    For the first graph, terms that included the word “wall” but which did not make a direct reference to a defense structure or border fortification were excluded from the search results (e.g. “Wall St.”, “Wallstein”, “wallet”). Retweets were also excluded.
    <p class="analysis">
    The count on “migration related-terms” includes the words “migr,” “Mexico,” “DACA,” “alien,” “caravan,” “border.” There was no other filter used in the search. Retweets were excluded.
