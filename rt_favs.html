    <p class="analysis">In Twitter, users show a positive response to comments giving them hearths ("faving" them). Whereas they only retweet (RT) when they want to spread or discuss a particular subject. In this sense, we quantify the support and impact of Trump’s tweets on migration (including comments on the wall) by measuring the number of RTs and favs that @realDonaldTrump has received.<br> 
    <br>  As shown in the graph above, the users' interaction with Trump's comments has consistently increased since June 2015. Nevertheless, while Favs and RTs were in a close proportion at the beginning of his presidential campaign (2:1), they distanced from each other over the time. <br>
    <br> In January 2018 they are in a ration of 5:1, which means that for every five user faving Trump’s tweets, there is one willing to retweet his comments. This block chart shows the volume of interaction os tweeter users with Trump's tweets containing migration related terms, including every time he mentions the wall.<br>
